# Preview
Script solving sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithm. Here is example:
```
7 3 0  | 4 6 5  | 0 0 8
0 0 0  | 3 9 2  | 4 0 5
5 0 0  | 0 0 0  | 0 6 9
- - - - - - - - - - - -
0 0 7  | 0 0 0  | 8 4 0
0 5 0  | 8 0 4  | 0 3 0
0 9 0  | 2 0 3  | 0 0 0

# Examples
Example to use to check if algorithm works properly.

First:
```
board = [
    [4,9,8,2,0,3,1,0,7],
    [0,0,0,5,0,8,2,0,4],
    [0,7,0,4,9,0,6,0,0],
    [8,0,0,0,4,0,0,6,5],
    [6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [2,0,7,0,5,9,0,3,1],
    [0,6,0,0,3,0,0,2,0],
    [9,8,0,1,0,0,4,0,0],
    [0,2,4,7,8,0,5,1,9]
]
```

Second:
```
board = [
    [7,8,0,4,0,0,1,2,0],
    [6,0,0,0,7,5,0,0,9],
    [0,0,0,6,0,1,0,7,8],
    [0,0,7,0,4,0,2,6,0],
    [0,0,1,0,5,0,9,3,0],
    [9,0,4,0,6,0,0,0,5],
    [0,7,0,3,0,0,0,1,2],
    [1,2,0,0,0,7,4,0,0],
    [0,4,9,2,0,6,0,0,7]
]
```




# Future plans
To create GUI and playable version of the game
